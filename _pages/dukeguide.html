<p>When writing for <a href="https://researchblog.duke.edu/" target="_blank"> the Duke Research blog</a>, there are no specific templates. 
However, the first rule of thumb is "don't write like a scientist." Your readers didn't click on a SciComm piece, because they want to know 
more about the miniscule 'details' - they want to know the 'finale', the point. You can't load the top of the story with a bunch of background and context (i.e., "Introduction" in a journal article). 
You have to get to the good stuff, the meat of the paper, as soon as possible (really, right from the get-go). That means asking: What 
did the researchers find? How do they know that? What does it mean to ME, the reader?</p>
  
<p>Second rule: Go easy on the numbers. Select a few, very powerful numbers and leave everything else out.</p>
 
<p>Third rule: Avoid jargon that an eighth-grader may not recognize. That's generally where the average American is in science literacy. They 
had high school biology 25 years ago, but they might not have been paying attention.</p>

<p>Fourth rule: The headline and lead are often the ONLY chance you get with most readers - especially in the mobile news age. It is not 
uncommon to write and revise those multiple times to get those right. Moreover, the headline and lead of a SciComm piece will differ from 
what is considered interesting to a scientist. For a scientist, we might think about a general statement of the unsolved questions of the field. 
For example, one of the scientist summary pieces we will read is titled: "How the human brain segments continuous experience." While this is a GREAT 
headline for memory scientists (summarizing how each memory is its own distinct memory), it is not tuned to catch the public eye; it uses language 
more oriented to a scientist (segment, continuous experience), and leads with the unsolved question rather than what the paper it covers MEANS to 
a general reader.</p>
  
<p>These tips were largely provided by <a href="https://newsoffice.duke.edu/staff-directory">Karl Bates</a>, who runs the Duke Research blog and who will work with 
you on your final Duke SciComm pieces. He will do an annotated edit-track on each paper and return your paper to show what he's thinking before you publish your piece together.</p>
 
<p>Finally, every blog post ALSO needs two or three relevant images (must know the copyrights/provenance/credit on each) AND a headshot of 
the author with name and position in school. If you don't have a headshot, we can set-up a time to take one of you.</p> 

<p>In class, we will deconstruct academic articles as well as science communication pieces. We will work towards ...

<p>To make this process easier, we are going to start small. First, we'll deal with non-Duke articles. You'll write a tweet summary of articles (May 20), 
write SciComm headlines (May 21), write an opening paragraph for a SciComm piece (May 23), and write multiple paragraphs for a SciComm piece (May 31). 
Then you'll select your specific Duke article, outline your piece (including headline; June 10), write a first draft of your SciComm piece (June 13), 
and then revise for your final (course) draft due June 19. All along the way, your classmates and I will provide feedback that 
will help you improve your science communication skills. Ultimately, this piece will be published on the Duke Research blog, which you can 
show your family and friends and any future employers interested in knowing how well you write to a general audience.</p>

<p>Sounds good? Let's get to work!</p>

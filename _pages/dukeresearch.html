<p>In this class, we will read about research done here at Duke. You will contribute to the cognitive psychology community at large by creating <a href="http://cogpsychduke2019.github/wikipedia" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> profiles of underrepresented cognitive psychologists, and you will contribute to the Duke cognitive psychology community by writing about the <a href="https://researchblog.duke.edu/"> research done at Duke for a lay audience.</a></p>

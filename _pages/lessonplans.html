<A NAME="week1"></a><h2> Week 1: May 15-May 17, 2019 </h2>

<p>In our first module, we will examine what constitutes engaging story-telling and scientific knowledge (Science Communication), why some methods are better for investigating specific research questions than others as well as current methodological issues within psychology (Cognitive Methods), and how you construct the world you see and feel around you (Perception). We will begin to critically consume academic journal articles and science communication pieces.</p>

<A NAME="week2"></a><h2> Week 2: May 20-May 24, 2019 </h2>

<p>Next we will consider how our brain prioritizes and processes information in a world that bombards our senses (Attention), in addition to how we feel and construct emotions (Emotion) and how that shapes our oral communication (Language). </p>

<p><i> Note that there is no class on Monday, May 27th - i.e., Memorial Day!</i></p>

<A NAME="week3"></a><h2> Week 3: May 28-May 31, 2019 </h2>

<p>The third module will consider how we reason and remember information (Knowledge), conjure possible and impossible scenarios as well as past events (Episodic Memory, Memory Mechanisms), and construct our own life stories (Autobiographical Memory). We will evaluate how to convey these core cognitive psychology concepts to a broad audience with science communication pieces.</p>

<A NAME="week4"></a><h2> Week 4: June 3-June 7, 2019 </h2>

<p>We will then apply our theories and skills to understanding more complex feats of the human mind, such as decision-making and interactions between memory, attention, and decision-making.</p>

<A NAME="week5"></a><h2> Week 5: June 10-June 14, 2019 & <A NAME="week6"></a> Week 6: June 17-June 21 + June 24, 2019 </h2>

<p>In our final modules, we will think about how we take shortcuts when making choices, how our memory and mind can be tricked and shaped by external events, and what factors promote better learning, both in an educational and academic context.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://cogpsychduke2019.github.io/week6.html" target="_blank">the week 6 lesson plan</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The first half of the course is primarily focused on basic science concepts within cognitive psychology, while the second half considers how these concepts are interlinked and directly applicable to other aspects of life (e.g., policy, education, history). </p>

To make things easier on you, I have created this site where you can upload your assignment and send it directly to me.

<p>
<FORM METHOD="post" ACTION="mailto:christina.bejjani@duke.edu" ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data"> 
Assignment Attachment: <INPUT TYPE="file" NAME="attachedfile" MAXLENGTH=50 ALLOW="text/*" >
<input type="submit" name="Upload" value="Upload" />
</FORM>
</p>
